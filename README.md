# Software Introduction
- The customer aske us to build a easy calculator to calculate two entrier numbers with four operators.
- Addition, Minus, Multiply, Divide are the four operators.
- The customer will input two numbers and one operator to the promt and return the result.

# How to use the calculater app
    $ python3 app.py


# What I need you to do
- In this practice, you will experiece the parrelel development   
- I need you to work on the ./calculator/operator.py file   
- I will work on the ./calculator/main.py file 

# Workflow
- Step 1: fork the repository to your personal repository (do it on github)
- Step 2: work on your personal repo  
- Step 3: create a different branch (pick your own branch name)
- Step 4: work on the job and commit it (tip: do tiny commit rather than heavy commit)
- Step 5: I make a unit test template in ./unit_test folder. Due to the python dependency issue, I will test the interior package function in ./unit_test folder. You can refer the ./unit_test/main_test.py file to build your own operator_test.py file. You need to go inside the ./unit_test folder and then run the testing file. For example, 

        $ cd ./unit_test 
        
        $ python3 main_test.py
        
- Step 6: merge the working branch into the main branch
- Step 7: open a Pull Request on github 
- Step 8: I will check the Pull Request and do code review on github

# Tool Recommendation
- I personally recommend Git Graph extension on VSCODE, it's a powerful tool for git control and git management
- In this tiny project, I will use VScode instead of xcode   

# Final Word  
- Lmk if you have any question with fork and pull request, they are a bit fresh to most people
- Good luck
